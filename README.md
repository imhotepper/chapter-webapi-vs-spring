# .Net Core WebApi vs Spring Boot

This is a prezentation about the 2 technologies and it's purpose is to higlight the similarities and differences between them.

The demo project is a Todos API with basic endpoints and a postgresql database. It exxplains the controller, model, service, validation, error handling, api to api call, scheduled jobs, testing, memory footprint and docker files.

It also contains 2 projects with the same features for a better comparison. 

Here are the projects runing live:
 * dotnet core 2/3 REST webapi <a href="http://ct-todos-cs.herokuapp.com/index.html" target="_blank"> .net core webapi link</a>
 * spring boot 2 REST api <a href="http://ct-todos-java.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui.html" target="_blank">spring boot api link</a>

 In each project there is a Dockerfile and a Docker-compose file so that it can be executed locally. The docker file is expecting a postgres installation to run on your localhost port 5432. For the docker-compose there is no other requirement than docker to be prezent.
