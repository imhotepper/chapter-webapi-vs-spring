# .Net Core WebApi vs Spring Boot

This is a prezentation about the 2 technologies and it's purpose is to higlight the similarities and differences between them.

It also contains 2 projects with the same features for a better comparison.

Here are the projects runing live:
 * dotnet core 2/3 REST webapi <a href="http://ct-todos-cs.herokuapp.com/index.html" target="_blank"> .net core webapi link</a>
 * spring boot 2 REST api <a href="http://ct-todos-java.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui.html" target="_blank">spring boot api link</a>
 
 The keynote prezentation link is here: <a href="https://github.com/imhotepper/chapter-webapi-vs-spring/raw/master/Spring%20Boot%20vs%20Core%20WebApi.key" target="_blank"> open me </a>
 
 In each project there is a Dockerfile and a Docker-compose file so that it can be executed locally. The docker file is expecting a postgres installation to run on your localhost port 5432. For the docker-compose there is no other requirement than the docke to be prezent.
